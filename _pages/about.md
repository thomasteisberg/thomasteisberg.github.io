I'm working on accelerating of understanding of Earth's ice sheets by improving the ways we use observational data to imform ice sheet models. I'm currently a [resident](https://astera.org/introducing-asteras-first-residency-cohort-and-opening-applications-for-the-second-cohort/) at Astera Institute.

I did my PhD in the [Stanford Radio Glaciology Lab](https://www.radioglaciology.com/), advised by Prof. Dusty Schroeder. As an engineer in a geophysics group, I designed radar instrumentation for studying Earth's ice sheets. I spent most of my Ph.D. co-developing [ORCA](https://orca.radioglaciology.com/) (Open Radar Code Architecture) and using it to develop and test [Peregrine](/projects/peregrine), a field-portable small fixed-wing UAV equipped with a miniaturized ice-penetrating radar.

I'm also interested in new ice-penetrating radar applications enabled by cheaper, more repeatable surveying, especially radar interferometry to better understand englacial motion.

I developed and maintain a [data portal](/projects/radarfilmstudio) for accessing an archive of early ice-penetrating radar data collected in the 1970s and 1980s over Antarctica and Greenland. In many cases this data predates any nearby modern radar data by several decades, extending our historical view and improving our understanding of how the ice sheets are evolving.
