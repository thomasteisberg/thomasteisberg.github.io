	abstract = {The surface velocity of ice sheets is now measured at high spatial and temporal resolutions by satellite-borne platforms. The availability of this data has enabled rapid progress in both monitoring the evolution of ice sheets and understanding their underlying physical processes. Because the material properties of ice are spatially variable and poorly constrained, however, it is difficult to infer englacial velocity fields from surface velocity alone. Radio echo sounders, also called ice‐penetrating radars, can image beneath the surface and resolve englacial layering, commonly assumed to represent isochronal surfaces. In limited settings, interferometric measurements of these englacial layers have also been used to infer vertical velocity within ice sheets, however these applications to date have focused on areas where layers could be assumed to be flat. Here, we develop the mathematical relationships between observed englacial layer deformation and englacial velocity fields, making no assumptions about the shape of the layers and very minimal assumptions about the internal velocity structure. Taking this general approach opens up the possibility of using interferometric radio echo sounding to reconstruct three‐dimensional englacial velocity fields at large scale across ice sheets. Potential applications of this method include data‐driven estimation of ice rheology, inference of englacial conditions, and estimation of basal sliding. The proposed technique provides more direct constraints on these processes than has previously been available by remote sensing methods and offers the potential to both understand and predict the flow of ice sheets and glaciers.},

	year = {2024},
	abstract = {Ice-penetrating radar systems are critical instruments for observing the subsurface conditions on Earth's ice sheets. Traditionally, ice-penetrating radars have not been widely accessible to the glaciological community (as in the case of resource-intensive airborne systems) and/or have been limited in their ability to be reconfigured and optimized for studying different glaciological targets (as in the case of hardware-defined radar systems). To alleviate the challenges associated with this situation, we have developed the Open Radar Code Architecture (ORCA), which is an open-source radar software codebase that allows commercially available software-defined radios (SDRs) to be used as coherent ice-penetrating radars. Here, we describe the architecture of our code, characterize coherence on SDRbased radars, and demonstrate techniques we use to improve SNR and overall performance. We also highlight the variety of SDR options available to potential users and discuss tradeoffs between different system configurations.},

	abstract = {We present an ice-penetrating radar data set acquired over the Greenland ice sheet by aircraft during the years 1971, 1972, 1974, 1978, and 1979. The data set comprises over 177 000 km of ﬂight lines and contains a wealth of information on the state of the Greenland ice sheet, including information on ice thickness and englacial properties. During data collection in the 1970s, the data were recorded on optical ﬁlm rolls, and in this paper, we document the digitization of these ﬁlm rolls and their associated geographical information. Our data digitization enables interaction with and analysis of the data and facilitates comparison with modernday radar observations. The complete data set in full resolution is available in the Stanford Digital Repository (https://doi.org/10.25740/wm135gp2721; Karlsson et al., 2023), with the associated technical reports. Part of the data set is available as low-resolution JPG ﬁles at the Technical University of Denmark’s data repository (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.ﬁgshare.c.7235299.v1; Karlsson et al., 2024), with associated technical reports and digitized geographical information . The Stanford Digital Repository serves as long-term storage, providing archival historic preservation in perpetuity, and is not intended as a primary data access point. The Technical University of Denmark (DTU) data repository serves as a primary entry point for data access, with ﬁles organized according to acquisition year and ﬂight line in a simple folder structure. Here, we release the full data sets to enable the larger community to access and interact with the data (Karlsson et al., 2023).},

	abstract = {During the 1970s, the first large-scale ice-penetrating radar surveys were conducted over Antarctica and Greenland through a collaboration between the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, the National Science Foundation, and the Technical University of Denmark [1]. This pioneering work represents the earliest available large-scale measurements of the sub-surface conditions of Earth’s two major ice sheets. In many cases, data collected as part of this survey pre-dates other available data in the area by decades. As we experience increasingly rapid changes in Antarctica and Greenland, understanding the historical states of these ice sheets takes on increased importance. Although 45-55 years is a short time in the evolution of continent-scale ice sheets, this dataset is unique in that it represents direct measurements over massive spatial scales. Unfortunately, integration of this data into models has proven extremely difficult due to unique challenges in how the data was collected and stored. We introduce our efforts to build digital tools for this analog dataset to bring this data into the modern era and make it accessible to researchers.},

Direct measurements of ice thickness, however, are sparse, necessitating techniques for interpolating these measurements. One class of interpolation methods enforces physical constraints to transform the problem into an inversion. A challenge with these approaches is that multiple unknown parameters must be solved for simultaneously. We introduce a new numerical approach to solving for mass conservation-constrained ice thickness maps. This technique, based on a physics-informed neural network, allows for the flexible incorporation of a range of soft constraints. In the future, this could enable simultaneous estimation of ice velocity, bed topography, and sliding parameters.},
