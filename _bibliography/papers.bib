	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a type of {MIMO}-{SAR} architecture in which the elements are arranged along the axis of platform motion. We show that this architecture can be used to improve the robustness and accuracy of angular estimation compared to single-element {SAR} given array location uncertainty. We compare three different architectures for side-looking radars ({SAR}, {SIMO}, and {SIMO}-{SAR}) and show that in the presence of array location uncertainty, {SIMO}-{SAR} proves more resilient. Measurement results using a commercial automotive radar module have been performed to verify this effect.},

	title = {Closed-Loop Ultrasonic Power and Communication with Multiple Miniaturized Active Implantable Medical Devices},
	abstract = {An ultrasonic array system is designed for wirelessly powering and communicating with implantable medical devices. A flexible hardware interface is used to drive a 32-element linear phased array with emphasis on programmability and efficiency rather than bandwidth or peak power. Various beam patterns and data modulation schemes are verified at a depth of 6 cm in a tissue phantom with more than sufficient harvested power for typical implant applications. The power transfer efficiency is also characterized versus depth. Finally, a closed-loop test is performed with two mm-sized devices demonstrating both power and data transfer. This system provides a platform for more complex adaptive therapies combining sensing, communication, and stimulation.},
