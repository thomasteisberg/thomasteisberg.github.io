Stanford Radio Glaciology has led the effort to [digitize almost 1000 rolls of optical film](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/radarfilm) containing data from an airborne geophysical survey of Antarctica conducted in the late 1960s and 1970s. This survey was the first of its kind and provides a snapshot of subglacial conditions and ice thicknesses that predates other measurements by, in some cases, decades.

In order to make this data accessible to others, I developed an open-source website to help visualize and explain the vast array of data.
